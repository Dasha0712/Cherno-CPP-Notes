### **What is a Union in C++?**

A **union** in C++ is a special type of data structure that allows **different data types to share the same memory**. It means that in a union, all members (variables) **share the same space in memory**. You can store one value at a time, and whichever member you last wrote to, the union will interpret that memory as that type.

### **Key Points:**
- All members of a union **use the same memory space**.
- The size of a union is equal to the size of its largest member.
- You can **only store one member's value at a time**.
- If you write a value to one member, it will overwrite the value in the other members.

### **Simple Analogy:**

Imagine a **single parking space**. You can park either a **car**, **motorbike**, or **bicycle** in that space, but **only one vehicle at a time**. So, if you park a car, there's no room for the motorbike or bicycle. If you park a motorbike, the car is gone.

Now, think of the **union** like that parking space:
- You have multiple types of "vehicles" (members), but you can **only use one vehicle at a time**. The size of the parking space is enough for the **largest vehicle** (largest member).

### **Union Example in C++:**

Letâ€™s look at a simple example to understand how unions work in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

union Vehicle {
    int car;     // car type (size: 4 bytes)
    float motorbike;  // motorbike type (size: 4 bytes)
    char bicycle;  // bicycle type (size: 1 byte)
};

int main() {
    Vehicle v;
    
    // Storing an integer value in the union (car type)
    v.car = 5;
    std::cout << "Car (int): " << v.car << std::endl;
    
    // Storing a float value in the union (motorbike type)
    v.motorbike = 2.5;
    std::cout << "Motorbike (float): " << v.motorbike << std::endl;
    
    // Storing a character value in the union (bicycle type)
    v.bicycle = 'A';
    std::cout << "Bicycle (char): " << v.bicycle << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Union `Vehicle`:**
   - The union `Vehicle` has three members: `car`, `motorbike`, and `bicycle`. They represent different types: an integer (`int`), a floating-point number (`float`), and a character (`char`).

2. **Memory Sharing:**
   - All three members (`car`, `motorbike`, and `bicycle`) share the **same memory space**. The size of the union will be the size of the largest member (in this case, 4 bytes because both `car` and `motorbike` are 4 bytes).

3. **Storing and Overwriting Values:**
   - When we store a value in `v.car`, it occupies 4 bytes.
   - Then, when we store a value in `v.motorbike`, it overwrites the value in `v.car` because both share the same memory.
   - Finally, storing a value in `v.bicycle` (1 byte) overwrites the value in `v.motorbike`.

### **Output:**
```
Car (int): 5
Motorbike (float): 2.5
Bicycle (char): A
```

---

### **What Happens in Memory?**

- The union **reserves enough space** for the largest type (in this case, 4 bytes for `int` or `float`).
- However, the data in the union is **overwritten** each time a new value is stored.

### **Why Use a Union?**

- **Memory Efficiency:** Since the members share the same memory, it saves space compared to using separate variables for each type.
- **Flexibility:** You can treat the same memory as different types (int, float, char) when necessary.

---

### **Summary:**

Think of a **union** like a **single parking space** where you can park only one type of vehicle at a time. You can park a car (integer), motorbike (float), or bicycle (character), but **only one at a time**. All these vehicles share the same parking space, which makes it memory-efficient, but only one vehicle can be parked at a time.
