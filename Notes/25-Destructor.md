## Explanation of the Code

### Overview:
This C++ program demonstrates the use of constructors and destructors in a class. The `Entity` class initializes its member variables in the constructor and prints messages when objects are created and destroyed.

### Code Breakdown:

```cpp
#include<iostream>

#define print(x) std::cout << x << std::endl
```
- `#include<iostream>` allows input and output operations.
- `#define print(x) std::cout << x << std::endl` is a macro that simplifies printing values.

```cpp
class Entity {
public:
    int x, y;
    Entity() {
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
        print("Entity created");
    }
```
- The `Entity` class has two integer variables, `x` and `y`.
- The constructor initializes `x` and `y` to `0` and prints "Entity created".

```cpp
    void show() {
        print(x);
        print(y);
    }
```
- The `show` method prints the values of `x` and `y`.

```cpp
    ~Entity() {
        print("Entity destroyed");
    }
```
- The destructor `~Entity()` prints "Entity destroyed" when an object is destroyed.

```cpp
int main() {
    Entity e;
    e.show();
    e.~Entity();
    return 0;
}
```
- In `main()`, an `Entity` object `e` is created.
- The `show()` function prints the initialized values of `x` and `y`.
- The destructor is explicitly called using `e.~Entity();`, which is unnecessary because destructors are called automatically when the object goes out of scope.

### Key Points:
1. **Constructor (`Entity()`)**: Automatically called when an object is created.
2. **Destructor (`~Entity()`)**: Automatically called when an object is destroyed.
3. **Avoid Explicit Destructor Calls**: Calling `e.~Entity();` manually is not needed since it gets called automatically at the end of the scope.

### Expected Output:
```
Entity created
0
0
Entity destroyed
Entity destroyed
```
- The destructor message appears twice because it was explicitly called in `main()` and also executed when `e` went out of scope.

### Improvement Suggestion:
Remove the explicit `e.~Entity();` call to let the destructor work automatically.
